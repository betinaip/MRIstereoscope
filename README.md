# **MRI-stereoscope for human neuroimaging**

## The problem
Dichoptic displays are not widely in neuroimaging due to the technical challenges of achieving high quality dichoptic display in the MRI-scanner.

## The solution
We present a novel, miniature MRI-stereoscope, produced in a mechanical workshop using commonly available materials. It provides high quality dichoptic image display inside the brain scanner. Our device can accelerate research of the biological basis for binocular vision by providing a low-cost, high quality option for dichoptic displays for neuroscience research.

## What are we doing?
We are a team of visual neuroscientists, working to understand the binocular visual system using novel technology. This device was developed to address the need for high quality and low cost dichoptic display in the brain scanner.

The system works with a 3T Siemens 64 channel headcoil with a back-projection system.

The repository contains the design file for making the MRIstereoscope. The .igs file can be opened from any CAD software and used to make the device. Other construction materials are described in the paper, and can be obtained commercially.

The .igs file can be modified to suit different experimental visual set-ups.

## Who are we?

The device was developed by researchers at the University of Oxford, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences. It was manufactured by the University of Oxford Physics Department.
